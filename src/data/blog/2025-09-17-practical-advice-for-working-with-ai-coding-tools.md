I stumbled upon some incredibly practical advice for working with Claude Code, Cursor, and Github Copilot that I think every engineer needs to know.

Here are a few of my favorite takeaways:

## ➡️ Create memory files

Use files like `CLAUDE.md` or `.cursorrules` to give the AI some lasting context about your project's structure.

## ➡️ Draft a solution first

Sketch out an idea yourself, even just on paper, and then use the AI to help you polish it.

## ➡️ Ask for different approaches

Have the LLM lay out a few different options with pros and cons so you can choose the best path forward.

## ➡️ Treat the AI like a partner

Explain problems to it and work together to find a solution, just like you would with a coworker.

## ➡️ Write detailed specs

Be super specific, even down to the exact function signatures you want the AI to implement.

## ➡️ Interrupt and redirect

The moment you see the AI going down the wrong path, jump in and get it back on track.
