💡 Voice notes is so powerful, fast and effortless!

I've switched to mostly using voice notes instead of typing, and it's been a game-changer for me.

Here's why:

## • It's 3x Faster

We speak at around 130-160 wpm, but most of us only type at 40-50. I just tested myself and got 46 wpm, so you can get your thoughts down at least 3x faster just by talking.

## • It's All About Flow

The real win isn't just speed. You stop overthinking and just talk, capturing ideas without that annoying pause between thinking and typing.

## • It's Incredibly Powerful

For getting raw thoughts down quickly, it's a seriously effective tool.

Of course, you might want to skip it when you're in a crowded elevator haha

But seriously, give it a try 😃
