Most engineers blame AI tools for generating bad outputs.

They're feeding them vague inputs and expecting perfect code.

You wouldn't tell a junior developer "make the thing work" and expect excellent results.

You would break down the problem.

Explain the requirements.

Review their code.

And iterate again.

AI is no different. It's a probabilistic tool trained on patterns.

The issue isn't the tool. It's your fundamentals.

If you can't decompose problems, AI will give you messy solutions.

If you can't communicate requirements clearly, AI will hallucinate and waste your time.

If you don't understand system design, AI will pile up technical debt.

If you don't review critically, AI will ship bugs.

Next time you use AI tools:

Explain your problem and requirements in detail.

Provide it context about your project.

Plan and brainstorm solutions together.

Chunk execution into smaller phases.

Question its outputs.

Refine and reiterate.

Happy coding!
