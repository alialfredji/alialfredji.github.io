If you've stopped being curious, you're already behind.

It doesn't matter how many years of experience you have.

AI is changing the way you work.

New frameworks are replacing the ones you mastered.

Patterns you relied on are becoming old.

Experience only matters if you keep building on it.

Ask better questions.

Try things you don't understand yet.

Take on problems that make you uncomfortable.

Learn from others who know things you don't.

The moment you think you know enough is the moment you stop growing.

Stay curious. Stay relevant.
