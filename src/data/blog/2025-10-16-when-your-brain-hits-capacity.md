Most people treat their brain like it has infinite capacity.

By 2pm, you've already processed 15,000+ thoughts.

You've context-switched multiple times.

Made dozens of decisions.

Sat through meetings.

Checked Slack 47 times.

Your emotional state is nowhere near where it was in the morning.

Here's what you can do to handle it.

## 5 power actions for when my brain hits capacity:

• **Write it down** → Clear your head

• **Walk** → Reset everything

• **Rest** → Process in background

• **Workout** → Release tension

• **Talk to someone** → Gain perspective

These aren't productivity hacks.

They're survival tools for when your emotional state shifts.

Which happens multiple times a day. To everyone.

Whether you're coding, managing a team, designing systems, or running a business - your brain follows the same rules.

The best work I've done came after I stopped trying to brute-force through mental fatigue.
