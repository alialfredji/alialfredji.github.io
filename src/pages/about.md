Hey, I'm Ali. Senior Software Engineer, father, and someone who can't stop asking and reflecting on what works and what doesn't. Always asking better questions and trying new approaches.

Over the past 10+ years, I've built full-stack applications, led engineering teams, and started my own company. That startup experience taught me more than any job ever could. The highs, the lows, and everything in between.

AI is changing how we build software, and I'm all in. I spend my time experimenting with new tools, automating workflows, and building side projects to see what's actually possible. I write about what I'm learning: AI-native development, software engineering that works, and productivity systems that save time.

Outside of work, you'll find me with my kids and family, playing football (midfielder, always orchestrating), or out in nature. I enjoy helping others grow, whether through mentoring, writing, or just talking things through.

If you're an engineer or founder who wants to work smarter, stick around.
